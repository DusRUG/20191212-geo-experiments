Slides from My Loan's talk "Measuring the incremental impact of marketing campaigns with geo experiments"

The challenge with understanding the impact of brand marketing campaigns, especially for offline advertising, is that we are not always able to measure the additional conversions generated by a campaign. One way to address this issue is to use a geo experiment: a quasi-experiment that measures the causal impact of a marketing intervention. It's similar to an A/B test but instead of assigning individuals randomly to control and treatment groups, geographic regions are used to define the groups. I will give an introduction on how we use geo experiments at trivago to test the effectiveness of our marketing investments and explain how the tests are set up and analyzed in R.
